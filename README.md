# RISC_V-Pipelined-with-hazard-units.
I've completed a project on Processor design. In which i designed a RISC-V cpu with 37 instructions with a maximum frequency of 630 MHz. There are separate MUXs for selection of all Load, Store and Branch instructions. Alu unit has branch flag which tells whether to take branch or not. Hazard unit was given to remove the data and control hazards.
